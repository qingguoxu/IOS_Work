The app is for personal use. Since it can help user quickly send out the location to their emergency contact via a text message.
Hopefully, it can help user whenever they need help at a strange place or in a danger situation that the user cannot speak to
their friend and cannot call the police.
This is a very simple app. It use core data as a local database. User can register at the first time and then login.
It will keep user logged in unless user logout by themselves. 
The main interface is quite simple.
